// MAZ Pocket — typing by voice.
//
// Every text field on this device is a 240px strip driven by a thumb keyboard,
// which is the slowest way to get a sentence into it. Dictation is therefore
// not a feature of one screen: it belongs to the shared TextField, so Notes,
// Tasks, Decision, Sprint, Reminders, Snippets and the command palette all
// gain it at once and behave identically.
//
// The flow is deliberately one-shot rather than streaming: record to a cache
// WAV, hand it to the host's /transcribe/raw, drop the file, return the text.
// Streaming would need a socket the firmware does not keep open, and a thought
// short enough to fit in a field is short enough to send in one piece.
