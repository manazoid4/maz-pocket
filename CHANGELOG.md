# Changelog

## v1.0.0 — WORK CONSISTENCY

- Home remains exactly six surfaces and now reads CALL / CAPTURE / AGENTS / CONTROL / MEMORY / WORK; the stable internal `flow` ID is unchanged.
- WORK opens directly to a Cardputer glance for JOB HUNT, MAZ WORKS and pinned custom tracks, with current/target values, a fixed seven-day strip, and last-known data labelled STALE after three missed Host polls.
- Existing Focus, Sprint, Tasks, Reminders, Shift and Retro remain available one level deeper under WORK TOOLS.
- The authenticated phone control centre is now `WORK | AUTHORITY`, with WORK as the default tab, one-tap Application logging, raw event breakdowns, Undo Last, seven-day history and Manage Tracks.
- Added a versioned WAL/foreign-key SQLite store with idempotent template seeding, stable event IDs, retry-safe writes, session-scoped reversals, archive-safe history, daily/weekly local-time aggregation and crash/interruption coverage.
- Added bounded Cardputer JSON and streaming firmware parsing: at most four pinned tracks, exactly seven history entries, 4096-byte ceiling, and no fake zero replacement on malformed/offline data.
- Added custom track creation/edit/reorder/pin/pause/archive, stable event-type renames, bounded input validation, mobile 360–430 px coverage and server-source-of-truth refresh.
- Added v0.8-to-v1 upgrade verification proving `.env`, authority/pairing state and WORK data survive the shipped installer/update path.
- Release packaging excludes machine-local runtime logs in addition to tests, caches, bytecode and `.env` state.
- Added an explicit fourth MAZLATEST route from Cardputer to MAZ Core, using loopback-only 9router model `MazLatest` with no silent fallback or device-side credentials.
- Preserved CALL, CAPTURE, AGENTS, CONTROL/AUTHORITY, MEMORY, pairing, Beam, screen mirror, firmware staging, M5Launcher hand-back, AI routing and installer behavior.

## v0.8.0 — CONTROL

- CALL MAZ: renamed COMM experience, spoken reply playback on fresh installs, P replay, V voice toggle, A cloud/local/auto route.
- CAPTURE + Teach-by-Demonstration: TEACH DEMO / BRAIN DUMP / VOICE RECORDER; host-side display recording with microphone narration and MARK events, extracted to Results Inbox.
- Agent workbench (AGENTS): AGENT STATUS, PLAN, CREW, RETRO, PROJECTS; CREW planning is read-only, actual subprocess execution requires a signed phone-approved PROJECT FULL+ grant.
- Prompt Deck (MEMORY): project-aware task templates compiled with current project + Agent Nudge evidence.
- Phone-approved full PC authority: external authority broker with READ ONLY / PROJECT FULL / PC FULL / ADMIN grants, approved/denied from the authenticated phone `/control/` page; signed grants gate PowerShell/cmd execution and coding-agent subprocess launches.
- Pairing + Token ID: safe 12-character fingerprint, hidden pairing token with on-device reveal, phone-control URL.
- `mazpocket.local` rebuilt as a phone-first control centre.
- Fixed the M5Launcher self-deletion bug — MAZ no longer invalidates its own running firmware when returning to Launcher; boot partition is switched via `esp_ota_set_boot_partition()` instead, with a CI regression guard against destructive running-app flash writes.
- Debug Capsules: bounded, redacted project/Git/Core/device/system/model/job/authority snapshot for troubleshooting.
- `START-HERE.cmd` installer changes are now explicitly opt-in at every destructive step (MAZ Core install/update, Cardputer SD copy, browser launch); never formats media or writes Cardputer flash directly.

## v0.7.1 — installer hotfix, speed pass and packaging cleanup

- Fixed the Windows install path. `START-HERE.cmd` runs `powershell.exe`, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 decodes a BOM-less script with the ANSI code page. Two em dashes in `setup-all.ps1` therefore arrived as cp1252 text ending in `0x94`, a smart closing quote that PowerShell accepts as a string delimiter, which unbalanced the quoting and produced misleading `}` / `elseif` parse errors at lines 85-92.
- Executed installer scripts are now plain ASCII and are packaged with a UTF-8 BOM, so neither PowerShell edition can mis-decode them.
- `START-HERE.cmd` prefers `pwsh.exe` when present and still falls back to Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- CI now builds the release package, extracts the generated `MAZ-Pocket-v<version>-Install.zip` and validates the scripts users actually download by parsing and dry-running them under real `powershell.exe`, on both the 5.1 fallback and the preferred shell.
- Speed pass: Pocket boot animation cut from 900 ms to 250 ms, the stale v0.5 system prompt replaced with a compact v0.7 one, retained history halved from 24 to 12 turns, SMART/FAST Ollama keep-alive raised to 15/60 minutes, and handheld local generation capped at 160 tokens.
- Packaging cleanup: `MAZ-Core-vX.Y.zip` now ships runtime files only — `tests/`, `.pytest_cache`, `__pycache__` and `*.pyc` are excluded, and that is a permanent release rule.
- No firmware behaviour, product surface or MAZ Core capability changed.

## v0.7 — FIELD (release candidate)

- Home NOW priority strip and programmable quick actions 1–4.
- Global Fn+Space Context Ask with bounded current-screen context.
- Durable auto-retrying Outbox for voice, Context Ask and Beam.
- Beam short text/URL transfer with durable Core queue and Windows clipboard handoff.
- On-demand Laptop CPU/RAM/GPU/VRAM/battery/Ollama status.
- FIELD mode and Shift Clock.
- Smarter local-AI resource profiles: SMART/SAVE/FAST with adaptive context and measured Ollama usage.
- Unified MAZ Core version reporting.
- Full split client + Cardputer ZIPs are now a CI-enforced release rule.
- Documentation and Knowledge Vault architecture updated.

## v0.6

- One-entry Windows install/update flow.
- Stable per-user MAZ Core installation and Core-only USB pairing.
- Phone-first verified firmware staging to SD for M5Launcher.
- Local primary -> backup model failover.
- Hardened nonblocking local portal and authenticated LCD mirror.
- Single version source and release packaging cleanup.

## v0.5.1

- Runtime health instrumentation and bounded Host worker.
- COMM durable WAV path and safer PC actions.
- Verified installer/release workflow hardening.
